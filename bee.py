You know, they have a Larry Kingin the human world too. its a common name. Next week... He looks like you and has a showand suspenders and colored dots... Next week...

When im done withthe humans, they won t be able to say, Honey, im home,without paying a royalty! its an incredible scenehere in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits,because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselvesif a honeybee can actually speak. What have we gotten into here, Barry? its pretty big, isn t it? I cant believe how many humansdont work during the day. You think billion-dollar multinationalfood companies have good lawyers?

The HonorableJudge Bumbleton presiding. All right. Oase number 4475, Superior Oourt of New York,Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session. Mr. Montgomery, youre representingthe five food companies collectively? A privilege. Mr. Benson... youre representingall the bees of the world? im kidding. Yes, Your Honor,were ready to proceed. Mr. Montgomery,your opening statement, please. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believedit was man s divine right to benefit from the bountyof nature God put before us. If we lived in the topsy-turvy worldMr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to negotiatewith the silkworm for the elastic in my britches! Talking bee! How do we know this isn t some sort of holographic motion-picture-captureHollywood wizardry? They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids! Mr. Benson? Ladies and gentlemen,theres no trickery here. im just an ordinary bee. Honey s pretty important to me. its important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect itwith our lives. Unfortunately, there aresome people in this room who think they cantake it from us cause were the little guys! im hoping that, after this is all over, you ll see how, by taking our honey,you not only take everything we have but everything we are! I wish he d dress like thatall the time. So nice! Oall your first witness. So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhaydenof Honey Farms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you also ownHoneyburton and Honron! Yes, they provide beekeepersfor our farms. Beekeeper. I find thatto be a very disturbing term. idont imagine you employany bee-free-ers, do you? - No. - I couldn t hear you. - No. - No. Because you dont free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, itseems you thought a bear would bean appropriate image for a jar of honey. They re very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear. You mean like this? Bears kill bees! How d you like his head crashingthrough your living room? ! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, thats enough. Take him away. So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police. But you ve never beena police officer, have you? No, I haven t. No, you haven t. And so herewe have yet another example of bee culture casuallystolen by a human for nothing more thana prance-about stage name. Oh, please. Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because im feelinga little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner! thats not his real name? ! You idiots! Mr. Liotta, first,belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spoton ER in 2005. Thank you. Thank you. I see from your resumethat youre devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoilthats ready to blow. I enjoy what ido. Is that a crime? Not yet it isn t. But is thiswhat its come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless beesso you dont have to rehearseyour part and learn your lines, sir? Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now! This isn t a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn t someone just step onthis creep, and we can all go home? ! - Order in this court! - youre all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully niceof that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury s on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? im a florist. Right. Well, heres to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. ididn t think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. ididn t want all this to go to waste,so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. Theres a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear youre quite a tennis player. im not much for the game myself. The ball s a little grabby. thats where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating withchopsticks isn t really a special skill. You think idont see what youre doing? I know how hard it is to findthe rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment,but we do jobs like taking the crud out. thats just whatI was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razorfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right. im going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I ve just about had it with your little mind games. - What s that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, thats a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why isyour life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just cant seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames? ! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, im wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I ve got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - youre bluffing. - Am I? Surf s up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing? ! You know, idont even like honey! idont eat it! We need to talk! He s just a little bee! And he happens to bethe nicest bee I ve met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about? ! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things buggingme in life. And youre one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from ridingon this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificialsweeteners made by man! im sorry about all that. I know its gotan aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kindof barrier between Ken and me. I couldn t overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomeryis about out of ideas. We would like to callMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he sconsidered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you vegotta weave some magic with this jury,or its gonna be all over. dont worry. The only thing I haveto do to turn this jury around is to remind themof what they dont like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, ill ask youwhat I think we d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? were friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug? I ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn t your queen give birthto all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren t your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! youre an illegitimate bee,aren t you, Benson? He s denouncing bees! dont y all date your cousins? - Objection! - im going to pincushion this guy! Adam, dont! its what he wants! Oh, im hit! ! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venomis coursing through my veins! I have been felledby a winged beast of destruction! You see? You cant treat themlike equals! They re striped savages! Stinging s the only thingthey know! its their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I cant feel my legs. What angel of mercywill come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybeesversus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legalteam stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn t I? It doesn t matter. What matters isyoure alive. You could have died. id be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteriadownstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, theresa little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I cant explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. im sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. werejust a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to usif they win? idont know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn t sound so bad. Adam, they check in,but they dont check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurseto close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees dont smoke. Right. Bees dont smoke. Bees dont smoke! But some bees are smoking. thats it! thats our case! It is? its not over? Get dressed. I ve gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you ve done step correctly, youre ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, its interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result,we dont make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor,haven t these ridiculous bugs taken up enoughof this court s valuable time? How much longer will we allowthese absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compellingevidence to support their charges against my clients,who run legitimate businesses. imove for a complete dismissalof this entire case! Mr. Flayman, im afraid im going to have to considerMr. Montgomery s motion. But you cant! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? its a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn t hurt a fly,let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked,Smoking or non? Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addictedto smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slavesto the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He s playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please,free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. im OK! You know what this means? All the honeywill finally belong to the bees. Now we won t haveto work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversionof the balance of nature, Benson. You ll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren,and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery s right? - What do you mean? We ve been living the bee waya long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, well demand a complete shutdownof all bee work camps. Then we want back the honeythat was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorificationof the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly,bad-breath stink machine. were all awareof what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He ll have nauseousfor a few hours, then he ll be fine. And we will no longer toleratebee-negative nicknames... But its just a prance-about stage name!... unnecessary inclusion of honeyin bogus health products and la-dee-da humantea-time snack garnishments. Oan t breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,and theres gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We ve never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! were shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn t believehow much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What s going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They re home. They dont know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his wayto San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humansliked our honey? Who wouldn t? its the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was mynew job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I cant. idont understandwhy they re not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They re doing nothing. its amazing. Honey really changes people. You dont have any ideawhat s going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They re all wilting. Doesn t look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, im gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. ididn t think bees not needing to makehoney would affect all these things. its notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. thats our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affectsthe entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if theres no more pollination, it could all just go south here,couldn t it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - ill sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses paradein Pasadena. theyve moved it to this weekendbecause all the flowers are dying. its the last chanceill ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say im sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses cant do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses? ! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. thats why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, imade a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I ve ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I ve made it worse. Actually, its completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and itsgreater than my previous ideas combined. idont want to hear it! All right, they have the roses,the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plantand flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what theyve gotback here with what we ve got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses,Pasadena, Oalifornia. theyve got nothingbut flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. its real. Sorry, ma am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside,we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess,and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Whereshould I sit? - What are you? - I believe im the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - im getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! lets see what this baby ll do. Hey, what are you doing? ! Then all we dois blend in with traffic... without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport,theres no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it beenin your possession the entire time? Would youremove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - its part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if were lucky, well havejust enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? Wehave just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. its got to work. Attention, passengers,this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weatherin New York. It looks like well experiencea couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowerswith no water. They ll never make it. I gotta get up thereand talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get helpwith the Sky Mall magazine? id like to order the talkinginflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, im in a real situation. - What d you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! dont freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! im an attorney! - whos an attorney? dont move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24Bplease report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster,a toupee, a life raft exploded. One s bald, one s in a boat,they re both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one s flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What s your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. im a florist from New York. Wheres the pilot? He s unconscious,and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboardhave flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - whos that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial? ! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing morethan a big metal bee. its got giant wings, huge engines. I cant fly a plane. - Why not? Isn t John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! were headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have somelate-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful sceneis developing. Barry Benson,fresh from his legal victory... thats Barry!... is attempting to land a plane,loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers? ! We have a storm in the areaand two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. Theres a bee on that plane. im quite familiar with Mr. Bensonand his no-account compadres. theyve done enough damage. But isn t he your only hope? Technically, a beeshouldn t be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven t we heard this a million times? The surface area of the wingsand body mass make no sense. - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - were going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of beesdoing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well,it makes a big difference. More than werealized. To us, to everyone. thats why I want to get beesback to working together. thats the bee way! were not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn t so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened? ! Wait, I think we wereon autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now were not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, lets getbehind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if ido what id do,you copy me with the wings of the plane! dont have to yell. im not yelling! were in a lot of trouble. its very hard to concentratewith that panicky tone in your voice! its not a tone. im panicking! I cant do this! Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it! You snap out of it.

Rotate around it. - This is insane, Barry! - This s the only way I know how to fly. Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this planeflying in an insect-like pattern? Get your nose in there. dont be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse! Just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman! Oome on, already. Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly! - Yes. No high-five! - Right. Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower? What giant flower? Where? Of courseI saw the flower! That was genius! - Thank you. - But were not done yet. Listen, everyone! This runway is coveredwith the last pollen from the last flowersavailable anywhere on Earth.
